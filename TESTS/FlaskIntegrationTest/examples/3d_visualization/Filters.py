                Frequency of incoming frames defined in seconds. Used

                on the very first frame). Default=30
    min_cutoff:  
                Minimum cutoff frequency. Start by tuning this parameter while
                keeping `beta=0` to reduce jittering to the desired level. 1Hz
                (the default value) is a a good starting point.
    beta:       
                Cutoff slope. After `min_cutoff` is configured, start
                increasing `beta` value to reduce the lag introduced by the
                `min_cutoff`. Find the desired balance between jittering and lag. Default=0

                Cutoff frequency for derivate. It is set to 1Hz in the
                original algorithm, but can be turned to further smooth the
                speed (i.e. derivate) on the object. Default=1
