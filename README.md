Graceland aka Serinda V4

This is a complete rewrite of SERINDA.  It is named after the TV Show Graceland in which Serinda Swan was a main character.

## This Version

I am also integrating BabylonJS fully.  Previous releases had some BabylonJS work, but didn't integrate it fully where the orthographic camera and the translation from OpenCV was off.

From this point on, I will rework the installer, the startup, the Rust and C integration as well as much more.

I look forward to the last 7 years of work coming together better than it was before.


## PREVIOUS VERSIONS

Previous versions used a system I developed for plugins.  Some of those plugins did slow down the system.  I also relied on the browser to provide access to speech.  Now, all speech is done in Python via either Google or Sphinx.
