<h2>What is SERINDA?</h2>
Sophisticated Engaging Rider Interface Near-eye Digital Assistant or SERINDA.<br/><br/>
It's a Mixed Reality Intelligent Personal Assistant using Python3, Flask, HTML/CSS/JS, and OpenCV.  It was originally supposed to be for HMD on a motorcycle.  It is now, more of an HMD for daily life.

<h2>How To Startup SERINDA</h2>
I still have some work to do with the installers and requirements.txt - aka merging the two together.  There are libraries
that will be needed for Mac and Linux variants.  There are some notes in the installers/python3Installs.sh file.  You will
need to install OpenCV.

python3 startup.py

when running startup.py the server will start up in the terminal and open the url in an instance of chrome.  Then the page will keep attempting to connect until it can connect to the server

<h2>Thanks</h2>
I started learning OpenCV about 5 years ago thanks to Adrian at PyImageSearch.  His tutorials are always easy to follow and the information is invaluable.

Here are just a few of the tutorials I followed to build this application:

<h2>Licensing</h2>
I have attempted to document where code comes from if I didn't write it from scratch.  To this extent the code has comments
that contain links to StackOverflow pages, github projects, and more.  That doesn't mean I copied wholesale.  It simply 
means I drew inspiration from somewhere.  It doesn't exclude copy and paste.

I chose the MIT license because I think if you want to use any of the code for any reason in your work, for any reason,
then you are free to do so.  I would like a snippet of recognition by name or by project.  But it's yours to do with as
you please and, as always, we're not responsible for anything you do with this code nor are held liable for anything this
code does.  use at your own risk.

Some libraries are licensed under LGPL2, LGPL3, MIT, BSD - I have attempted to list all of those here.
