    Fix Snips NLU setup
    Once running simplify what I want it to do
        like what is the thing I want out of this?
        list tasks for it
        set up the display for the individual display elements
            like how am I going to display PDFs in an AR/MR viewer?
    Find my projector module and how I'm going to send the display to my eye

    Get OpenCV coordinates and send to BabylonJS
    Using OpenCV coordinates display a BabylonJS item in that location on screen
    Refine LeapMotion hand points for both hands
    Use hand and finger points to "click" on items in the HUD
    Use hand and finger points to move items in the HUD
    Make camera transparent for testing all of the above

    Rearchitect site so that it can be entirely front-end for prototyping
        or a mix of the two (sending an image and data from opencv to the front end)

    Rearchitect plugins so they can be front-end or backend
        Maybe add a property to not run a plugin - like front-end or backend always run, but can not run one specifically
    Figure out how to add Rust extensions to the code programatically like the plugins do
